Conflict, a natural and inevitable part of human existence, arises when individuals or groups hold differing opinions, interests, or needs. It can manifest in various forms, from personal disagreements to large-scale societal tensions. While conflict is often associated with negativity and strife, it also presents opportunities for growth, understanding, and positive change.
