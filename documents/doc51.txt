Conflict can be seen as a catalyst for change, prompting individuals and societies to reassess their positions, challenge assumptions, and seek innovative solutions. It can provide a platform for dialogue, where conflicting parties can express their viewpoints, listen to one another, and find common ground. Constructive conflict resolution can lead to improved relationships, enhanced cooperation, and the development of creative solutions that address the underlying issues.
