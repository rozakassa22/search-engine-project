At its core, conflict stems from the diversity and complexity of human experiences and perspectives. It arises when people's values, beliefs, or desires clash. Conflict can be fueled by factors such as competition for resources, power dynamics, or historical grievances. It can emerge in interpersonal relationships, within families, communities, or on a global scale.
